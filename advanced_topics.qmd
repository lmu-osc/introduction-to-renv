# Library Management

https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/index.html#library-management

Emphasis on `record()`, and `history()`/`revert()`. Also talk about the `lockfile_*()` functions as useful documentation for understanding the contents of the lockfile and what everything means.

Possible discuss `checkout()`?
