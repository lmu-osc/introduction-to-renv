-   explicit snapshot of {rmarkdown}?
-   **Go to the Exercise 3 Folder**
-   should use an RMarkown file here to demonstrate that it is important to explicitly add the markdown package to the snapshot sometimes


> The example of a prominent function in the psych R package: Setting rotate = "promax" requires the GPArotation package which the package lists under "Suggests". When using the renv defaults, the GPArotation package would not be tracked in the project, right?

``` r
library(psych)
fa(Holzinger, nfactors = 2, fm = "ml", rotate = "promax")
# Loading required namespace: GPArotation
# Failed with error:  ‘there is no package called ‘GPArotation’’
# Error in kaiser(loadings, rotate = "Promax", ...) : 
#   GPArotation is required for the Kaiser normalization
```

Need to explicitly add the GPArotation package to the project with `renv::record()`.
