# Tutorial Structure


This **self-paced tutorial** is intended to take 1-2 hours to complete, depending on your previous familiarity with the theoretical and programming components of dependency management and R. Content has been written with novice R users in mind, but this tutorial (hopefully) provides useful information on setting up reproducible computational environments for R users of any skill level.

The tutorial is split into the following sections:

1.  **Background** introduces a simplified definition and reasoning for reproducibility, its relation to managing software dependencies, and some of the nuances of dependencies in R.
2.  **{renv}** discusses the main functions of the {renv} package, and just enough of the underlying mechanics of the package to be useful.
3.  **Exercises** contains a handful of practical exercises that walk users through the main components of using {renv}, and highlights some common mistakes or issues users might encounter.
4.  **Optional Content** dives into some of the more technical details of {renv}, caching, and related topics. This section is only recommended for users with more advanced use cases or troubleshooting needs.

Although optional for the general content in this tutorial, **knowledge of git and GitHub** will be necessary for the Exercises especially if you would like to receive feedback or troubleshoot issues remotely. Check out [our tutorial](https://lmu-osc.github.io/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/) on this topic if needed!
