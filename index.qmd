# Tutorial Structure

This **self-paced tutorial** is intended to take 1-2 hours to complete, depending on your previous familiarity with the theoretical and programming components. It is meant to be comprehensible for novice R users, but (hopefully) provides useful information on setting up reproducible computational environments for R users of any skill level.

The tutorial is split into a Learning component where you will read about software dependencies, understand some of the nuances of dependencies in R, and be introduced to the [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package.

## Prerequisites

This is a standalone tutorial, and we only assume some familiarity with R (and that you are using RStudio or another IDE). The following software should be installed:

* [R, recommend v4.3.X or more recent](https://www.r-project.org/)
* {renv}, installed with `install.packages("renv")`
* [RStudio, optional](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
