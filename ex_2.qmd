title: "Using `restore()`"
---

As with the previous exercise, it is **recommended** that you fork the repository to your GitHub account and clone it to your local machine to follow along with the examples. This will allow the course facilitators to see your work, provide feedback, and troubleshoot with you as needed.

If you're not familiar with using git and GitHub, you can skip the forking and cloning steps and instead download a zip file of the repository.
