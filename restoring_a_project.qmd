Description about how to restore a {renv} library from an existing project

Three most likely scenarios

# From a GitHub Repo

* clone
* run restore()
* should not be anything else to do


# From a lockfile

* place the lockfile in the directory you are working on your R project from. ideally you are already using an R Project `.Rproj` file.
* run restore()
  - Note the project argument for restore()

> **project** 
>
>   The project directory. If NULL, then the active project will be used. If no project is    currently active, then the current working directory is used instead.

# After Upgrading R

* Topic covered in more detail in the Caching page
* In short, you will need to restore() projects when upgrading by minor versions of R
    - semantic versioning: `major.minor.patch` so an upgrade from R4.3 to R4.4 will cause you to need to restore() your projects
