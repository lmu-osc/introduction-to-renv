The overall project is licensed under the **[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)** license found at [LICENSE](LICENSE.md); all code snippets are additionally licensed under the **[CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)** license found at [LICENSE-CODE](LICENSE-CODE.md).

Why two licenses? The CC BY-SA 4.0 license is for the content of the website, while the CC0 1.0 Universal license is for the code and configuration files. This is a common practice for websites that include code snippets and other content that may be reused in other projects, particularly because the CC BY-SA 4.0 license is not intended to be used with software.

# Notes

This tutorial was primarily written in 2024 using {renv} version 1.0.11. Major changes to the {renv} package are unlikely to occur in the near future, but it is always a good idea to check the [package's website](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) for the most up-to-date information, and to confirm that our tutorial is not out-of-date.
