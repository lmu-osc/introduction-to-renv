This can be useful if you are working on a project with multiple collaborators or if you need to reproduce your analysis at a later date.\nIt was, for many years, the most popular environment/dependency manager package for R, and was developed and maintained by RStudio/Posit. However, it has been soft-deprecated by Posit in favor of the {renv} package since at least April 2020. You should not start new projects with {packrat}, and, if possible, migrate existing projects using {packrat} over to {renv}. That said, it is worth knowing about the existence of this package because old tutorials, projects, and repos may still be using it.",

    "text": "{groundhogr}\n{groundhogr} is a community-driven package manager for R that was developed as an alternative to {packrat} and {renv}. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, and it has already gained a following among R users who are looking for an alternative to {packrat}, notably within psychological research and related fields. The example from their website is included below:\ninstall.packages(\"groundhog\")\nlibrary(\"groundhog\")\npkgs &lt;- c(\"rio\",\"metafor\")\ngroundhog.library(pkgs, \"2023-09-01\")\nThis example demonstrates a scenario in which you would like to install the rio and metafor packages as they were on September 1st, 2023. The groundhog.library() function is used to install these packages, and the date is specified as the second argument. One of the main benefits of this approach is that swapping the library() call for groundhog.library() is a simple change to make in your scripts, and it can be used to ensure that your collaborators are using the same package versions as you are.\nThe other main benefit of using {groundhogr} is that it is community-driven, meaning that it is developed and maintained by a group of R users who are interested in improving the package management experience in R outside of the Posit ecosystem. However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using {groundhogr}.\nThe package is still in relatively early stages of development so it may not be as stable or reliable as other package managers like {renv}. Likewise, the package does not have as many features as other package managers, so it will only be suitable for a smaller number of use cases. One of the largest benefits of learning {renv} instead of {groundhogr} is a result of a networking effect; {renv} is a transferable skill between academia and industry, and it is likely to be more widely used than {groundhogr} especially because of the professional support and software development the package receives from Posit.",

    "text": "{renv}\n{renv} is another one of Posit’s inventions, and is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and to work well with other Posit packages and CI/CD development pipelines. A separate tutorial will discuss CI/CD pipelines in detail, but, in short, using {renv} with your R projects allows you to easily automate advanced tasks like publishing Shiny apps, deploying website updates through GitHub Pages, checking the development status of R packages you create, and more. These benefits may seem a bit less tangible if you are new to R, but they are very important both for professional software development and for tasks that can make your work significantly easier in the long run.\nMore to the focus of this tutorial, however, {renv} allows you to create a “snapshot” of your package dependencies in just a handful of steps, summarized below:\nrenv::init()\nrenv::snapshot()\nThe results of this code will be discussed in the next chapter, but, in short, the “snapshot” it creates can be shared with collaborators or used to recreate your working environment at a later date.\nAs mentioned, {renv} is likely the most popular option for package management in R, and is a highly transferable skill between both academia and industry settings1. Thus, it is the one that I recommend using for new projects, and will be the focus of the rest of this tutorial on dependency management in R.\nMoreover, this package can be considered a relatively stable package as it has moved beyond it’s initial development stages into a version 1 release (currently at version 1.0.7). It is maintained by professional software engineers at Posit, and also receives open-source contributions and bug reports via the public GitHub repository.\nIn comparison to {groundhogr}, one of the supposed main drawbacks of {renv} is that it is project-based, meaning that you need to create an R Project (.RProj file) to use {renv} whereas {groundhogr} allows you to simply embed the function groundhog.library(pkg, date) into any R file. This is not a drawback in my opinion, as using an R Project structure helps manage your working environment, but it is worth noting that the default workflow for {renv} is not as flexible as {groundhogr} in this regard. However, {renv} also offers a similar workflow to {groundhogr} via the embed() and use() functions, discussed in the supplementary material of this tutorial.",

    "text": "Prior to discussing the various package managers in R, it is important to understand some R terminology relevant to dependency management, namely the concepts of and differences between packages, libraries, and repositories.\n\n\nPackages are collections of functions, data, and documentation that are bundled together in a single unit. They are the primary way that R users can extend the functionality of the base R language. For example, the {dplyr} package is a popular package for data manipulation that extends the base R language with functions like filter() and mutate(). The code below demonstrates how one can filter a data set using only R’s built-in capabilities and by using the popular data-cleaning package {dplyr}.\niris[iris$Species == \"setosa\" & iris$Sepal.Length &gt; 4.5, ]\ndplyr::filter(iris, Species == \"setosa\", Sepal.Length &gt; 4.5)\nBut why would someone want to accomplish this task in two different ways? Base R already has a large number of built-in functions and data structures that make it possible to work with data!\nHowever, base R can be difficult to use for complex data manipulation tasks, and the syntax can be verbose and overall subjectively difficult to work with. Packages like {dplyr} provide a more user-friendly interface for working with data, and they can make complex data manipulation tasks much easier to accomplish for beginners and advanced R users alike.\nThis example is not meant to highlight the benefits of {dplyr} specifically, but rather to illustrate the general utility of packages in R. Packages are, above all, a way to extend base R to make life easier for users, they provide alternatives to the base R packages, and user-contributed packages are an essential part of the R ecosystem.\n\n\nUpon installing R, you will have access to a number of pre-installed packages. These packages are part of the “base” R distribution and are considered essential for working with R. A list of such packages can be identified by searching your installed packages for the “base” and “recommended” packages (also summarized as “high” priority packages). The code below generates this list of pre-installed packages in R, along with some information about each package.\n\ninstalled.packages(priority = c(\"base\", \"recommended\")) %&gt;%\n  as_tibble() %&gt;%\n  select(Package, Version, Priority, Depends, Imports) %&gt;%\n  DT::datatable(options = list(paging=TRUE, scrollY = '300px', pageLength = 11))\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will likely recognize some of these packages, such as the {stats} package, which contains many of the commonly used statistical functions that are built into R like glm(). Other packages, like {utils} and {survival}, contain functions for other common activities like reading in files and for performing survival analysis, respectively.\nSomewhat confusingly, the base R distribution also includes a package called {base} containing many functions and data structures that are considered essential for working with R. Some references to “base R” are therefore referring to the base package, while others refer to the base distribution of the R language. This distinction is not particularly important for the purposes of this tutorial, but it is worth keeping in mind.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the pre-installed packages, you can also install additional packages from online repositories like CRAN, Bioconductor, and GitHub. You have likely already done this in the past by using the install.packages() function to download from CRAN and/or Bioconductor or devtools::install_github() to get a package from GitHub. Beyond that, there are principally no differences between the pre-installed packages and user-installed packages; they are both just collections of functions, data, and documentation in a defined format.\nPackages, of course, need to be stored somewhere on your computer, and this is where the concept of libraries comes in.\n\n\n\n\nLibraries are the location(s) on your computer1 where R packages are stored. When you install a package, it is downloaded from an online repository and stored in a library on your computer which is, in effect, just a directory/folder on your computer. Given that a library is just a folder, it should not be surprising that it is possible to have multiple libraries on your computer. R by default will look for packages in a set of default libraries, typically one in the user’s home directory and one in the system directory. These paths vary based on operating system, but the .libPaths() function can be used to see the libraries that are currently detected by default on your computer.\n# Example of running .libPaths() on a Mac. Results will vary across systems\n.libPaths()\n#&gt; [1] \"/Users/&lt;USER&gt;/Library/R/arm64/4.4/library\"                      \n#&gt; [2] \"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/library\"\nThe user directory is generally the default location for installing packages. Moreover, R will look for a package in the libraries in the order they are listed in the output of .libPaths(), so if you have two libraries with the same package installed, R will use the version of the package in the first library it finds.\nThe use of separate libraries is important because it allows you to manage different versions of packages and to avoid conflicts between packages that have the same name but different versions. For example, if you have two packages installed that both contain a function called foo(), R needs to know which version of foo() to use when you call it. By storing packages in separate libraries, R can keep track of which foo() you want to use. While managing these “namespace conflicts” is important, the focus of this tutorial, however, is more on the management of libraries and package versions.\nOf course, managing multiple libraries can be cumbersome and requires one to be mindful of which library is being used at any given time for installations and for your current R session. This is where package managers come in, as they can help you manage your libraries and package versions effectively, automatically, and without having to be an expert on navigating the file system of your computer.\nAs a side note: you may hear people refer to R packages as libraries, likely stemming from the fact that packages are attached to your R session using the library() function. While this generally will not lead to much confusion, it is important to keep in mind the distinction between packages and libraries for the purposes of this tutorial.\n\n\n\nA repository is a collection of packages that are available for download from a specific location. The most common repository for R packages is the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which hosted 21078 freely available packages at the last time this page was generated on July 22 2024. Another popular repository, Bioconductor, also hosts several thousand packages, but these packages are focused on bioinformatics and computational biology. Although not exactly a unified “repository,” GitHub is another popular location for R packages, and many developers use it to host their R packages and make the development process viewable by the public.\nRepositories are important because they provide a centralized location for R users to find and download packages. When you use the install.packages() function in R, you are downloading a package from a specific repository. By default, R will download packages from CRAN, but you can specify a different repository if you want to download a package from a different location. This is useful if you want to download a package from Bioconductor or GitHub, for example.\nRepositories are particularly relevant for package managers, as they provide a way for the package manager to know where to look for packages. When you use a package manager to install a package, the package manager will download the package from a specific repository and install it in a specific library on your computer. By specifying the repository and library, the package manager can ensure that the correct package is downloaded and installed in the correct location. Like with managing libraries, managing download repositories manually would be a tedious task at best, and package managers also largely automate this procedure.\nSee also the Posit article on packages, libraries, and repositories.",

    "text": "Intro to Management Practices\nGiven the potential complexity of software dependencies, it is important to manage these dependencies in a way that is both efficient and reproducible. This is especially important when sharing code with others or when working on a project over a long period of time so that you can easily recreate the environment in which the code was originally run.\nYou might already have a system in place for managing your dependencies, such as writing a document outlining installation procedures or you maintain a list of project packages, you might already use an automated package manager, or you might not have a system at all. Regardless of what you currently use, the manual and automated approaches are discussed below, and we clarify why you should use an automated approach for managing dependencies going forward.\n\nManual management\nAs noted, the dependencies for your project can be managed manually with e.g. a written list of the softwares and versions used. The main pros to this approach is that little technical knowledge is needed to create a simple Word or text file with this information, and such information can likewise be shared easily. However, the cons are that this approach is inexact, error-prone, still requires another user to manually download each package/library by hand, and the recursive dependencies are unlikely to be logged. This approach is not recommended for any serious project, especially if you are working with others or if you are working on a project over a long period of time.\n\n\nAutomated Management\nAutomated management of dependencies is the recommended approach for managing dependencies. This approach involves using a package manager to automatically install the necessary software dependencies for a project. The main pros to this approach are that it is more accurate, less error-prone, and can be easily shared with others. The cons are that it requires some technical knowledge to set up and can be more difficult to troubleshoot if something goes wrong.\nThere are many package managers available for different programming languages, and the choice of package manager can depend on the programming language you are using, the complexity of your project, and your personal preferences. Some common package managers for R and Python are listed below:\n\nRPython\n\n\nThe major current and historical options for managing R dependencies are:\n\n{renv} is arguably the most important package for managing R dependencies, is maintained by Posit, and is our recommendation\n{groundhogr} is a package that is similar to {renv}, and developed by independent, open-source contributors\n{packrat} is a deprecated package that is no longer recommended for new projects\n\n\n\nThe pip, pipenv, and poetry libraries can, generally speaking, be used for library management and for declaring necessary Python versions in the respective requirements.txt, Pipfile, and pyproject.toml files. However, one would usually use this in conjunction with software like Anaconda or Miniconda to manage Python versions and environments.\n\n\n\nThe next chapter delves into some necessary technical definitions in the R ecosystem. The chapters mentions some of the benefits of package managers, but the following chapter will really dive in to the details of package management in R while providing a discussion of the 3 major package managers for R.",

    "text": "Dependencies\nAt the first degree, you depend on packages to perform your analysis or for your project, and you likely have included these packages in your project via calls to library(), require(), or namespaced calls e.g. package::function(). It is quite obvious that these packages are dependencies of your project, and should be included in the renv.lock file.\nHowever, how does {renv} detect what packages are being used in the project? The renv:dependencies() function! This function works by searching all R-related files (e.g. .R, .Rmd, .qmd) for calls to packages. It is important to note that this function only detects packages that are actually used and properly declared in the project. Packages that are not used and packages that you use interactively (i.e. you never wrote a library(&lt;package&gt;) call in a .R/.Rmd script) will not be detected as a dependency.\nYou will likely never need to use renv::dependencies() directly, but being aware of what it does can be massively beneficial in troubleshooting issues in the future. More importantly, this function also underlies the renv:status() and renv::snapshot() functions which are essential for using {renv}.",

The hardware aspect is difficult enough as is, but softwares also have a variety of different versions, sometimes with minor changes that won’t affect output in any noticeable way, and sometimes those changes are breaking such that code simply no longer runs, or worse, the code still runs but provides different results than expected\n\nwhat are the challenges?\n\n\nDependency Mangement\n\n\nwhat is it? the process/steps for actually controlling and documenting the softwares and specific versions used in a project.\nthese can be managed informally with e.g. a written list of softwares used and versions if needed.\n\npros: there’s little technical knowledge needed here. anyone can type these out.\ncons: inexact, error prone, still requires another user to manually download each package/library by hand, and (big issue) the dependencies of packages are not explicitly declared.\n\nwhat does that last point mean? many packages or libraries that one will download also depend on other software packages. When downloading a package, the required dependencies are generally declared and they should be downloaded too. However, not all packages/libraries will declare specific versions of their dependencies, and a well-developed project will track these too.\nHowever, when including package dependencies, a project that appears to only use 5-10 libraries can actually be using a few hundred. (Note that this process works recursively.)\n\n\nGiven the complexity in all of this, automated solutions for dependency tracking are recommended.\nPython: requirements.txt, Pipfile, and pyproject.toml for pip, pipenv, and poetry respectively can, generally speaking, be used for library management and for declaring necessary Python versions.\n\nthis tutorial focuses on R and {renv} so no further comparison of these will be provided here\n\nR: {renv}, {packrat}, and {groundhogr} are the major options in the R ecosystem\n\n\nWhy {renv}?\n\n\n{packrat} was for many years the most popular environment/dependency manager package for R. It is maintained by RStudio/Posit, and still receives bug updates. However, it has been soft-deprecated by Posit in favor of the {renv} package since at least April 2020. You should not start new projects with {packrat}, and, if possible, migrate existing projects using {packrat} over to {renv}. That said, it is worth knowing about the existence of this package because old tutorials, projects, and repos may still be using it.\n{groundhogr}: this is an open-source project to enable dependency management, and appears to have some popularity within psychological research and possibly other fields. It claims to address some shortcomings of Posit Package Manager (discussed later), but my opinion is that the comparisons are misleading; {groundhogr} must be compared against {renv} combined with PPM, not just against PPM. That said, if your collaborators are using {groundhogr}, then I would recommend learning it to use it for those projects, but the benefits of {renv} make it the overwhelming favorable option.\n{renv}: this is another one of Posit’s inventions, and is now in its 1.X.X version iterations meaning it can be considered stable without any breaking changes likely to occur at least for many years. (This would generally be indicated with a minor release to e.g. 1.X+1.X or a major release to e.g. 2.X.X)\n\npros:\n\ndeveloped by professional software engineers at Posit so there is paid support. development, however, is also done open-source so people can independently propose bug fixes or raise issues\nlikely the most popular option already. learning this is a transferable skill between academia and industry.\nintegration with other Posit packages and development pipelines, in particular with CI/CD pipelines on GitHub repos. Another tutorial will discuss CI/CD pipelines, but, in short, using {renv} means you can more easily automate deploying websites through GitHub Pages, checking the development status of R packages you work on, deploy Shiny apps to servers, and run other automated process that require specific package versions because Posit has developed extensions that make this easier.\nit works at a project level (i.e. it should be paired with the use of an R Project/.RProj file). {groundhogr} notes this as a disadvantage so I suppose this requirement is subjective. However, I argue this is a pro because using an R Project structure helps manage your working environment\nNiche: {renv} also has integrations allowing it to be used with Python which can be useful in instances where you have a multi-language project. This would likely only be encountered in complex, multi-team analysis projects or possibly in industry settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Someone Else’s Computer\nWhen you share your code with others, you are effectively asking them to run your code on their machine, and it is unlikely that their computer is set up exactly like yours given how many degrees of freedom there are in operating systems, programming languages, software, and the different versions of these. A non-exhaustive list of examples where there might be software discrepancies are detailed below.\n\nMajor Machine & Software Differences\n\n\nOperating systemsProgramming languagesPackages/Libraries (Add-Ons)\n\n\nIt’s already well-known that different operating systems can have different software requirements. For example, some software might only be available on Windows, while others might only be available on MacOS or Linux.\nHowever, it is also important to consider that different versions of the same operating system can have different software requirements. For example, some software might only be compatible with Windows 10 and not Windows 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother obvious difference is the programming language used in a project. For example, a project written in R will not run (correctly) in a Python, MATLAB, or Julia environment.\nLess obvious, however, and more common as a pain-point, are the differences in versions of programming languages. For example, a project written in Python 3.8 might not run in Python 3.9 due to changes in the language, and most R packages are only tested for compatibility back to the 5 most recent minor releases of R (e.g. 4.4, 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0).\nFortunately, most modern programming languages are cross-compatible across recent, major operating systems without issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most likely pain point for reproducibility is the software add-ons, or packages/libraries, that are used in a project. For example, in R, there are over 20,000 packages available on CRAN, and in Python, there are over 200,000 packages available on PyPI.\nKeeping tracking of which packages are used and the specific versions of those packages is a major challenge in reproducibility.\nIn the context of the R programming language, most packages are likewise compatible across operating systems.",

If you have ever tried to run someone else’s code and it didn’t work, it was likely due to one of these reasons. Moreover, it’s not practical to manage most of these differences manually. For example, requesting that someone install Python v3.8.2, R v4.0.3, and a specific version of a package is technically possible, but exceptionally tedious and a poor use of time time. So this brings us to our core question: how do we set up a project to work on everybody’s machines?2 By managing our software dependencies, described in the next chapter.",

Content has been written with novice R users in mind, but this tutorial (hopefully) provides useful information on setting up reproducible computational environments for R users of any skill level.\nThe tutorial is split into the following sections:\n\nBackground introduces a simplified definition and reasoning for reproducibility, its relation to managing software dependencies, and some of the nuances of dependencies in R.\n{renv} discusses the main functions of the {renv} package, and just enough of the underlying mechanics of the package to be useful.\nExercises contains a handful of practical exercises that walk users through the main components of using {renv}, and highlights some common mistakes or issues users might encounter.\nOptional Content dives into some of the more technical details of {renv}, caching, and related topics. This section is only recommended for users with more advanced use cases or troubleshooting needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Software\n\n\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have the following software installed:\n\nR, recommend v4.4.X or more recent\nRStudio\n{renv}, installed with install.packages(\"renv\") from within R\n\nAlthough optional for the general content in this tutorial, knowledge of git and GitHub will be helpful for the Exercises especially if you would like to receive feedback or troubleshoot issues remotely. Check out our git and GitHub tutorial if needed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
