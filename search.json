    "text": "Cache Locations\nAlthough you will likely never need to interact with the cache directly, it can be useful to know where it is located on your system in case you need to troubleshoot any issues with {renv}. Moreover, seeing the actual cache locations can help make the concept of caching more tangible.\nThe {renv} caches for R packages will be nested in folders below one of the following locations, based on your operating system:1\n\n\nLinux: ~/.cache/R/renv/cache\nmacOS: ~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/cache\nWindows: %LOCALAPPDATA%/renv/cache\n\n\nWithin each of these cache folders, you should see sub-folders for each version of R that you have used with {renv}. For example, on a macOS system, you might see the following folders:\nlist.files(\"~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/cache/v5\", full.names = T)\n\n#&gt; [1] \"~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/cache/v5/macos\"\n#&gt; [2] \"~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/cache/v5/R-4.2\"\n#&gt; [3] \"~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/cache/v5/R-4.3\"\n#&gt; [4] \"~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/cache/v5/R-4.4\"\nThe {renv} package also provides a function to access the exact path to the cache used in your current project. This cache location will be slightly more specific than the paths listed above because it is a reference to the one cache specific to the version of R used in your project. You can access the path to the cache with the following code:\n# Run on a MacOS, and &lt;USER&gt; removed. \nrenv::paths$cache()\n#&gt; [1] \"/Users/&lt;USER&gt;/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/cache/v5/macos/R-4.4/aarch64-apple-darwin20\"\n\nPackages in the Cache\nEach of the caches will contain the packages that you downloaded for use in your projects as you were using that version of R. So for example, if you downloaded version 1.0.9 of {dplyr} while using R 4.3, you would find the package in the R-4.3 folder of the cache. If you then started a project using R 4.4 and downloaded version 1.1.2 of {dplyr}, you would find that version in the R-4.4 folder of the cache. Moreover, if another project using R 4.4 also needed version 1.1.4 of {dplyr}, it would be found in the R-4.4 folder of the cache.\nThis text might be an over-explanation of the concept so I’ll demonstrate it with a code chunk below that lists out the versions of {dplyr} in the cache.\nlist.files(\"~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/cache/v5/R-4.3/aarch64-apple-darwin20/dplyr\")\n#&gt; [1] \"1.1.2\" \"1.1.4\"\nlist.files(\"~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/cache/v5/R-4.4/aarch64-apple-darwin20/dplyr\")\n#&gt; [1] \"1.1.2\" \"1.1.4\"\nSo it seems that I have versions 1.1.2 and 1.1.4 of {dplyr} in the caches for both R 4.3 and R 4.4. However, this is merely a coincidence; it won’t always be the case that the caches have the exact same versions of packages. Let’s look at an example where the versions differ.\nlist.files(\"~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/cache/v5/R-4.3/aarch64-apple-darwin20/ggplot2\")\n#&gt; [1] \"3.4.3\" \"3.4.4\" \"3.5.0\" \"3.5.1\"\nlist.files(\"~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/cache/v5/R-4.4/aarch64-apple-darwin20/ggplot2\")\n#&gt; [1] \"3.5.0\" \"3.5.1\"\nIn this case, I have versions 3.4.3, 3.4.4, 3.5.0, and 3.5.1 of {ggplot2} in the cache for R 4.3, but only versions 3.5.0 and 3.5.1 in the cache for R 4.4 which is an expected outcome. I used several older version of {ggplot2} with an older version of R and then upgraded to a newer version of R and only used the newer versions of {ggplot2}!",

But how does {renv} use these caches, how does this relate back to your project libraries, and what is the role of the renv/library folder in your projects?\nEach {renv} project has its own library, located in the renv/library folder of the project. When you install a package in a project with {renv}, however, the package is not technically installed in the renv/library library. In fact, none of the packages used in your project are actually stored in this folder. Instead, the contents of these folders are “symlinks” to the packages in the shared library.\n\nSymlinks\nA symlink or “symbolic link” is a file that points to another file or directory. It is a reference to the original file or directory, and it can be used to access the original file or directory from a different location. Symlinks are important because they allow you to create shortcuts to files or directories, which can be useful for organizing files, accessing files from different locations, or creating symbolic links to files or directories that are located on different drives or partitions.\nIn the context of {renv}, the apparent packages in the renv/library folder of your project are actually symlinks that point to the packages in the cache!",

These packages are part of the “base” R distribution and are considered essential for working with R. A list of such packages can be identified by searching your installed packages for the “base” and “recommended” packages (also summarized as “high” priority packages). The code below generates this list of pre-installed packages in R, along with some information about each package.\n\n\nCode\ninstalled.packages(priority = c(\"base\", \"recommended\")) %&gt;%\n  as_tibble() %&gt;%\n  select(Package, Version, Priority, Depends, Imports) %&gt;%\n  DT::datatable(options = list(paging=TRUE, scrollY = '300px', pageLength = 11), style = \"bootstrap5\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will likely recognize some of these packages, such as the {stats} package, which contains many of the commonly used statistical functions that are built into R like glm(). Other packages, like {utils} and {survival}, contain functions for other common activities like reading in files and for performing survival analysis, respectively.\nSomewhat confusingly, the base R distribution also includes a package called {base} containing many functions and data structures that are considered essential for working with R. Some references to “base R” are therefore referring to the base package, while others refer to the base distribution of the R language. This distinction is not particularly important for the purposes of this tutorial, but it is worth keeping in mind when reading other R documentation.",

    "text": "Commonly Used Repositories\n\nCRAN and Bioconductor\nAs mentioned, CRAN is the most popular repository for R packages, and it is the default repository that R will use when you use the install.packages() function. CRAN has a strict set of guidelines for package submission, and packages are reviewed by a team of volunteers before they are accepted into the repository. This ensures that packages on CRAN are of high quality and are well-documented, which is why CRAN is often considered the gold standard for R package repositories.\nBioconductor, on the other hand, is a repository specifically for packages related to bioinformatics, genomics, and computational biology. Bioconductor has its own set of guidelines for package submission, and packages are reviewed by a team of experts in the field before they are accepted into the repository. This ensures that packages on Bioconductor are also of high quality and are well-suited for use in bioinformatics and genomics research.\n\n\nGitHub and GitLab\nGitHub and GitLab are popular version control platforms that are used by many R package developers to host their packages. These platforms are not strictly “repositories” in the same sense as CRAN and Bioconductor which are purpose-dedicated to hosting R packages, but they are often used as repositories for R packages. GitHub, in particular, is a popular platform for hosting R packages, and many R packages are available on GitHub for download and installation using the devtools::install_github() function.\n\n\nR-universe\nR-universe is a newer repository for R packages that is designed to make it easier for R users to share and discover packages. R-universe is not as curated as CRAN, so you may find packages that are not as well-tested or maintained as those on CRAN. However, R-universe can be a great place to find packages that are not available on CRAN or Bioconductor, and it is a good place to discover new and interesting packages that are being developed by the R community.\nIt is, however, worth noting that almost any package available on R-Universe will also be available on CRAN, Bioconductor, or GitHub/GitLab so it is not necessary to use R-Universe to find packages that are not available on CRAN or Bioconductor.",

The package manager will also keep track of the version of the package that was installed and any dependencies that the package has. This makes it easy to reproduce your projects and ensure that the correct versions of packages are used.\nIn the next section, we will discuss the various package managers that are available in R and how they can help you manage your packages and dependencies.\nSee also the Posit article on packages, libraries, and repositories.",

Consider installing it with install.packages(\"yaml\").\" \n\nOpen the presentation.rmd file.\n\nNote: RStudio may prompt you to install several packages in a yellow highlighted bar. You can ignore this request. A later step will address this.\n{rmarkdown} was listed as a dependency from this file, but there is not actually a call to the package in the file. Why do you think this is?\n\nWe want to simulate running someone else’s analysis without first installing the same packages as them: try to Render1 the presentation.rmd file.\n\nYou will be prompted to install some packages in a pop-up window. This is to install the {rmarkdown} package and its dependencies. Accept the prompt.\nThe {rmarkdown} package and its dependencies should install, but the rendering still fails. Why do you think this is? Take a careful look at the error message, and align it with the content of the presentation.rmd file.\n\nWe will now need to install all R packages required for this exercise. Run the command renv::restore().\n\nWhat happens?\nIf prompted with the question “Do you want to proceed? [Y/n]:”, type Y and press Enter.”\n\nOpen the billboard_100.R file, and run the code by pressing the Source button near the top right hand corner of the script.\n\nThis should create the top_billboard_rankings.rds file, needed in the next step.\n\nTry to render the presentation.rmd file.\n\nWhat happens?\n\nClose the project restore-exercises.Rproj.\n\nCongrats! You have restored someone else’s project and successfully rendered their analysis.",

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.\nUsing Creative Commons Public Licenses\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\n\n\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (“Public License”). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\n\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\nAdapter’s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nBY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\nCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\nEffective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\nExceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\nLicense Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.\nLicensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\nLicensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\nLicensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\nShare means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\nSui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\nYou means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License.

For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\nTerm. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\nMedia and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\nDownstream recipients.\nA. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nB. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.\nC. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\nNo endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nOther rights.\n\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\nPatent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\nAttribution.\n\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\nA. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\na copyright notice;\na notice that refers to this Public License;\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\nB. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\nC. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\nShareAlike.\n\nIn addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\nThe Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\nYou must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter’s License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\nYou may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter’s License You apply.\n\n\n\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\n\n\nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\nTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

    "text": "{groundhog}\n{groundhog} is a community-driven package manager for R that was developed as an alternative to {packrat} and {renv}. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, and it has already gained a following among R users who are looking for an alternative to {packrat}, notably within psychological research and related fields. The example from their website is included below:\ninstall.packages(\"groundhog\")\nlibrary(\"groundhog\")\npkgs &lt;- c(\"rio\",\"metafor\")\ngroundhog.library(pkgs, \"2023-09-01\")\nThis example demonstrates a scenario in which you would like to install the rio and metafor packages as they were on September 1st, 2023. The groundhog.library() function is used to install these packages, and the date is specified as the second argument. One of the main benefits of this approach is that swapping the library() call for groundhog.library() is a simple change to make in your scripts, and it can be used to ensure that your collaborators are using the same package versions as you are.\nThe other main benefit of using {groundhog} is that it is community-driven, meaning that it is developed and maintained by a group of R users who are interested in improving the package management experience in R outside of the Posit ecosystem. However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using {groundhog}.\nThe package is still in relatively early stages of development so it may not be as stable or reliable as other package managers like {renv}. Likewise, the package does not have as many features as other package managers, so it will only be suitable for a smaller number of use cases. One of the largest benefits of learning {renv} instead of {groundhog} is a result of a networking effect; {renv} is a transferable skill between academia and industry, and it is likely to be more widely used than {groundhog} especially because of the professional support and software development the package receives from Posit.",

    "text": "{renv}\n{renv} is another one of Posit’s inventions, and is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and to work well with other Posit packages and CI/CD development pipelines. A separate tutorial will discuss CI/CD pipelines in detail, but, in short, using {renv} with your R projects allows you to easily automate advanced tasks like publishing Shiny apps, deploying website updates through GitHub Pages, checking the development status of R packages you create, and more. These benefits may seem a bit less tangible if you are new to R, but they are very important both for professional software development and for tasks that can make your work significantly easier in the long run.\nMore to the focus of this tutorial, however, {renv} greatly assists in making your project reproducible by creating a “snapshot” of your package dependencies in as few as two commands:\nrenv::init()\nrenv::snapshot()\nThe results of this code will be discussed in the next chapter, but, in short, the “snapshot” it creates can be shared with collaborators or used to recreate your working environment at a later date. This is referred to as restoring a project, and can be done with the aptly-named renv::restore() function.\n\nPros and Cons\nAs mentioned, {renv} is likely the most popular option for package management in R, and is a highly transferable skill between both academia and industry settings1. Thus, it is the one that I recommend using for new projects, and will be the focus of the rest of this tutorial on dependency management in R.\nMoreover, this package can be considered a relatively stable package as it has moved beyond it’s initial development stages into a version 1 release (currently at version 1.1.1). It is maintained by professional software engineers at Posit, and also receives open-source contributions and bug reports via the public GitHub repository.\nIn comparison to {groundhog}, one of the supposed main drawbacks of {renv} is that it is project-based, meaning that you need to create an R Project (.RProj file) to use {renv} whereas {groundhog} allows you to simply embed the function groundhog.library(pkg, date) into any R file. This is not a drawback in my opinion, as using an R Project structure helps manage your working environment, but it is worth noting that the default workflow for {renv} is not as flexible as {groundhog} in this regard. However, {renv} also offers a similar workflow to {groundhog} via the embed() and use() functions, discussed in the supplementary material of this tutorial.",

The hardware aspect is difficult enough as is, but softwares also have a variety of different versions, sometimes with minor changes that won’t affect output in any noticeable way, and sometimes those changes are breaking such that code simply no longer runs, or worse, the code still runs but provides different results than expected\n\nwhat are the challenges?\n\n\nDependency Mangement\n\n\nwhat is it? the process/steps for actually controlling and documenting the softwares and specific versions used in a project.\nthese can be managed informally with e.g. a written list of softwares used and versions if needed.\n\npros: there’s little technical knowledge needed here. anyone can type these out.\ncons: inexact, error prone, still requires another user to manually download each package/library by hand, and (big issue) the dependencies of packages are not explicitly declared.\n\nwhat does that last point mean? many packages or libraries that one will download also depend on other software packages. When downloading a package, the required dependencies are generally declared and they should be downloaded too. However, not all packages/libraries will declare specific versions of their dependencies, and a well-developed project will track these too.\nHowever, when including package dependencies, a project that appears to only use 5-10 libraries can actually be using a few hundred. (Note that this process works recursively.)\n\n\nGiven the complexity in all of this, automated solutions for dependency tracking are recommended.\nPython: requirements.txt, Pipfile, and pyproject.toml for pip, pipenv, and poetry respectively can, generally speaking, be used for library management and for declaring necessary Python versions.\n\nthis tutorial focuses on R and {renv} so no further comparison of these will be provided here\n\nR: {renv}, {packrat}, and {groundhogr} are the major options in the R ecosystem\n\n\nWhy {renv}?\n\n\n{packrat} was for many years the most popular environment/dependency manager package for R. It is maintained by RStudio/Posit, and still receives bug updates. However, it has been soft-deprecated by Posit in favor of the {renv} package since at least April 2020. You should not start new projects with {packrat}, and, if possible, migrate existing projects using {packrat} over to {renv}. That said, it is worth knowing about the existence of this package because old tutorials, projects, and repos may still be using it.\n{groundhogr}: this is an open-source project to enable dependency management, and appears to have some popularity within psychological research and possibly other fields. It claims to address some shortcomings of Posit Package Manager (discussed later), but my opinion is that the comparisons are misleading; {groundhogr} must be compared against {renv} combined with PPM, not just against PPM. That said, if your collaborators are using {groundhogr}, then I would recommend learning it to use it for those projects, but the benefits of {renv} make it the overwhelming favorable option.\n{renv}: this is another one of Posit’s inventions, and is now in its 1.X.X version iterations meaning it can be considered stable without any breaking changes likely to occur at least for many years. (This would generally be indicated with a minor release to e.g. 1.X+1.X or a major release to e.g. 2.X.X)\n\npros:\n\ndeveloped by professional software engineers at Posit so there is paid support. development, however, is also done open-source so people can independently propose bug fixes or raise issues\nlikely the most popular option already. learning this is a transferable skill between academia and industry.\nintegration with other Posit packages and development pipelines, in particular with CI/CD pipelines on GitHub repos. Another tutorial will discuss CI/CD pipelines, but, in short, using {renv} means you can more easily automate deploying websites through GitHub Pages, checking the development status of R packages you work on, deploy Shiny apps to servers, and run other automated process that require specific package versions because Posit has developed extensions that make this easier.\nit works at a project level (i.e. it should be paired with the use of an R Project/.RProj file). {groundhogr} notes this as a disadvantage so I suppose this requirement is subjective. However, I argue this is a pro because using an R Project structure helps manage your working environment\nNiche: {renv} also has integrations allowing it to be used with Python which can be useful in instances where you have a multi-language project.

    "text": "https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/embed.html\nThis {renv} workshop focused on the main workflow of renv which is to use renv::init() to create a new project with an .Rproj file, and then to use renv::snapshot() to create a lockfile. This lockfile is then used to restore the project on another machine or to share with collaborators.\nHowever, there are two other functions that are useful for some workflows: renv::embed() and renv::use(). These functions are useful when you simply want to include packages in a project by embedding them in a script in your library. Typically you will see people include install.packages() calls at the top of their scripts to ensure that the necessary packages are installed. This can be improved upon by using renv::embed().\nrenv::embed() detects the packages in use in a file, captures the versions currently in use in your project, and then places a call to renv::use() at the top of that same file. This ensures that the necessary packages are installed when the script is run. This is useful for sharing code with collaborators because they do not need to install the packages themselves, and has less overhead than using {renv} in a project with a lockfile.\nThe downside to this approach is that caching is not available, and the packages are not tracked in a lockfile. This means that the versions of the packages are not guaranteed to be the same across different machines. This is a trade-off that you will need to consider when deciding whether to use renv::embed() or a full lockfile.\n\n\n\n Back to top",

Note that repos generally do not (and should not) contain the renv/library folder–this is intended behavior. The renv/library contains “symlinks” to the actual package files on your machine, and these symlinks are not portable across machines1. Moreover, the renv/library folder can be quite large and is not necessary for restoring a project.\nThe steps for restoring a project from a GitHub repository are as follows:\n\nClone the repository to your local machine with git clone\nOpen the *.Rproj file\nRun renv::restore()\n\nThere should not be anything else to do!

    "text": "After Upgrading R\nSomething that may come as a surprise is the need to restore a project after upgrading R. This occurs because the {renv} package creates a separate cache for each major and minor version of R that you use. A more detailed explanation of this can be found in the caching chapter, but a summarized version is also provided here.\n\nTo first clarify “major” and “minor” upgrades: they refer to semantic versioning of software which is a way of providing version numbers to software using three numbers separated by periods: major.minor.patch. For example, an upgrade from R4.3.2 to 4.3.3. is a “patch” while an upgrade from R4.3 to R4.4 is a “minor” release. Minor releases occur approximately once per year, and, after installing a new minor release, you will need to restore your project.\nIf you install a new major or minor version of R, you will need to ensure that the version of R you are using is compatible with your project(s). There are two ways to achieve this:\nThe first option is to update your project to use the new version of R. This can be done by running renv::update() to update the packages in your project (particularly the base R packages that came with the new version of R), and then running renv::snapshot() to update the renv.lock file.\nThe second option is to switch between R versions using a tool like rswitch or rig. These tools are useful if you are working on multiple projects that require different versions of R, or if you have projects where it’s not possible to update the version of R being used.",

It is quite obvious that these packages are dependencies of your project, and thus need to be included in the renv.lock file.\nHowever, how does {renv} detect what packages are being used in the project? The renv:dependencies() function! This function works by searching all R-related files (e.g. .R, .Rmd, .qmd) for calls to packages. It is important to note that this function only detects packages that are actually used and properly declared in the project. Packages that have only been used interactively will not be detected as dependencies because they are not saved or used in any of the project files.\nYou will likely never need to use renv::dependencies() directly, but being aware of what it does can be massively beneficial in troubleshooting issues in the future. More importantly, this function underlies the renv:status() and renv::snapshot() functions which are essential for using {renv}.

For example, you might have noticed that when installing 1 new package, R asks you if you want to install additional packages. These additional packages are dependencies of the package you are installing, and cumulatively they create a “dependency tree.” To get a visual representation of this, consider the following example displaying the recursive dependency tree for the {dplyr} package.\n\npak::pkg_deps_tree(\"dplyr\", dependencies = \"hard\")\n#&gt; ℹ Loading metadata database\n#&gt; ✔ Loading metadata database ... done\n#&gt; \n#&gt; dplyr 1.1.4 ✨🔧 ⬇ (1.60 MB)\n#&gt; ├─cli 3.6.3 ✨🔧 ⬇ (1.39 MB)\n#&gt; ├─generics 0.1.3 ✨ ⬇ (81.91 kB)\n#&gt; ├─glue 1.7.0 ✨🔧 ⬇ (159.50 kB)\n#&gt; ├─lifecycle 1.0.4 ✨ ⬇ (124.78 kB)\n#&gt; │ ├─cli\n#&gt; │ ├─glue\n#&gt; │ └─rlang 1.1.4 ✨🔧 ⬇ (1.89 MB)\n#&gt; ├─magrittr 2.0.3 ✨🔧 ⬇ (233.52 kB)\n#&gt; ├─pillar 1.9.0 ✨ ⬇ (652.06 kB)\n#&gt; │ ├─cli\n#&gt; │ ├─fansi 1.0.6 ✨🔧 ⬇ (383.06 kB)\n#&gt; │ ├─glue\n#&gt; │ ├─lifecycle\n#&gt; │ ├─rlang\n#&gt; │ ├─utf8 1.2.4 ✨🔧 ⬇ (206.91 kB)\n#&gt; │ └─vctrs 0.6.5 ✨🔧 ⬇ (1.89 MB)\n#&gt; │   ├─cli\n#&gt; │   ├─glue\n#&gt; │   ├─lifecycle\n#&gt; │   └─rlang\n#&gt; ├─R6 2.5.1 ✨ ⬇ (83.20 kB)\n#&gt; ├─rlang\n#&gt; ├─tibble 3.2.1 ✨🔧 ⬇ (688.89 kB)\n#&gt; │ ├─fansi\n#&gt; │ ├─lifecycle\n#&gt; │ ├─magrittr\n#&gt; │ ├─pillar\n#&gt; │ ├─pkgconfig 2.0.3 ✨ ⬇ (18.45 kB)\n#&gt; │ ├─rlang\n#&gt; │ └─vctrs\n#&gt; ├─tidyselect 1.2.1 ✨🔧 ⬇ (224.68 kB)\n#&gt; │ ├─cli\n#&gt; │ ├─glue\n#&gt; │ ├─lifecycle\n#&gt; │ ├─rlang\n#&gt; │ ├─vctrs\n#&gt; │ └─withr 3.0.0 ✨ ⬇ (242.00 kB)\n#&gt; └─vctrs\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Key:  ✨ new |  ⬇ download | 🔧 compile\n\n\nThis tree shows the dependencies of the dplyr package at the top level, and the dependencies of those dependencies nested below each package. The tree is recursive, meaning that it will continue to show dependencies of dependencies until it reaches the end of the dependency chain. This is a simplified example, but it is important to understand that the dependencies of dependencies can be quite complex and can lead to a large number of packages being installed in your project. Above all, you should note that all of the packages on this dependency tree need to be recorded in the renv.lock file to ensure that your project is reproducible.\nYou might have noticed the argument dependencies = \"hard\" in the function call. The dependencies argument is used to specify the kinds of dependencies to install. However, the discussion about dependencies so far has implied that another package is either a dependency or not, and you might now be asking yourself: are there different kinds of dependencies? Yes, there are! To be more specific, there are different levels of dependencies, discussed below.",

You will be able to successfully use R and {renv} without knowing the difference between hard and soft dependencies 99% of the time especially because most packages you download will only have Hard dependencies.\nHowever, it is still worthwhile to be aware that these these differences exist when using automated package managers as they will default to capturing just the Hard dependencies, but you might encounter scenarios where you mistakenly expect the snapshot to include the Soft dependencies. In such cases, you might need to explicitly renv::record() the dependency into the renv.lock file. Examples of this scenario will be revisited in the exercises.",

A project that is consistent should produce the following output when renv::status() is run:\nrenv::status()\n#&gt; No issues found -- the project is in a consistent state.\nHowever, if there are issues with the project, the output will indicate what the issues are.

The installed column indicates whether the package is installed in the project library, the recorded column indicates whether the package is declared in the lockfile, and the used column indicates whether the package is actually used in the project. In this example, the packages are installed and used in the project, but are not declared in the lockfile. This is an inconsistent state, and the issues should be resolved by running renv::snapshot().",

    "text": "A Brief Definition\n\nI propose to consider the question “What is reproducibility?” As reproducibility is such a central concept in science, one would think that it would be clearly defined. However, this is not the case. Reproducibility is an elusive concept. It has no single commonly agreed upon definition. Rather, it has many different, and each of these captures central, but different properties of it…\n– Odd Erik Gundersen1\n\nGundersen explores many definitions put forward for “reproducibility”, but, for the purposes of this tutorial, his exploration of reproducibility is best summarized as “the ability of independent investigators to draw the same conclusions from an experiment by following the documentation shared by the original investigators.”2\nIn principle, this sounds simple enough–provide others with enough information, and they should be able to reproduce your work! Achieving this in practice is, of course, a vastly complex endeavor that requires careful planning and execution. Above all, opinions on what constitutes sufficient “documentation” or how much documentation is necessary to achieve reproducibility can vary widely.\nOne might assume that academic publications provide all of the information required for an independent researcher to reproduce a publication; the requisite background on the topic, the data cleaning choices, and the exact statistical methods employed to arrive at a conclusion are theoretically included in a paper.3 In practice, a written publication generally cannot capture all of the nuances of data cleaning, exploration, and analysis employed by the original researchers. As a result, reproducing an analysis result only from a written description is, at best, incredibly time-consuming, and, at worst, an impossible endeavor.\nTo address the shortcomings of written descriptions, researchers must also strive to publish their code, data, and ideally both code and data together such that the complete documentation of the project is available to others. This tutorial specifically covers how to document the R version and R packages used in a project to ensure that the code can be run on other machines.",

When you run your code on your machine, you are running it in an environment that you have set up and configured to your liking. You have installed the software you need, perhaps have set up specific paths, and configured various settings to your preferences.",

    "text": "Someone Else’s Computer\nWhen you share your code with others, you are effectively asking them to run your code on their machine, and it is unlikely that their computer is set up exactly like yours given how many degrees of freedom there are in operating systems, programming languages, software, and the different versions of these. A non-exhaustive list of examples where there might be software discrepancies are detailed below.\n\nMajor Machine & Software Differences\n\n\nOperating systemsProgramming languagesPackages/Libraries (Add-Ons)\n\n\nIt’s already well-known that different operating systems can have different software requirements. For example, some software might only be available on Windows, while others might only be available on MacOS or Linux.\nHowever, it is also important to consider that different versions of the same operating system can have different software requirements. For example, some software might only be compatible with Windows 10 and not Windows 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother obvious difference is the programming language used in a project. For example, a project written in R will not run (correctly) in a Python, MATLAB, or Julia environment.\nLess obvious, however, and more common as a pain-point, are the differences in versions of programming languages. For example, a project written in Python 3.8 might not run in Python 3.9 due to changes in the language, and most R packages are only tested for compatibility back to the 5 most recent minor releases of R (e.g. 4.4, 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0).\nFortunately, most modern programming languages are cross-compatible across recent, major operating systems without issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most likely pain point for reproducibility is the software add-ons, or packages/libraries, that are used in a project. For example, in R, there are over 20,000 packages available on CRAN, and in Python, there are over 200,000 packages available on PyPI.\nKeeping track of which packages are used and the specific versions of those packages is a major challenge in reproducibility.\nIn the context of the R programming language, most packages are likewise compatible across operating systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome real-world examples:\n\nOperating systems: Windows 95 gives different results,4 and neuroimaging analysis results can vary based on OS5\nProgramming languages: R switched its default random number generating process at version 3.6.0,6 and R versions from 4.4.0 give different (albeit more consistent) values for the density() function7\nPackages/libraries: JASP changed the default Bayesian ANOVA8",

    "text": "All of the Machines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpect No One to Already Have the Required Software\n\n\n\n\nDon’t expect others to have the software you rely on.\nEven if others have the software, don’t expect them to have the same version.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the software environment of a project can be incredibly complex, with many degrees of freedom. If you have ever tried to run someone else’s code and it didn’t work, it was likely due to one of these reasons. Moreover, it’s not practical to manage most of these differences manually. For example, requesting that someone manually install Python v3.8.2, R v4.0.3, and specific versions of dozens of packages is technically possible, but exceptionally tedious and a poor use of time. So this brings us to our core question: how do we set up a project to work on everybody’s machines?9 By managing our software dependencies, described in the next chapter.",
